# ── Task A ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TASK_A_NOTES = "The model appeared to propose tool calls in its message, but the harness reported that no tool calls were actually made. As a result, no venue was confirmed, no catering cost was calculated, and no weather result was returned."   # optional — anything unexpected

# Has generate_event_flyer been implemented (not just the stub)?
TASK_B_IMPLEMENTED = True   # True or False

# The image URL returned (or the error message if still a stub).

# The prompt sent to the image model. Copy from terminal output.
TASK_B_PROMPT_USED = "Professional event flyer for Edinburgh AI Meetup, tech professionals, modern venue at The Haymarket Vaults, Edinburgh. 160 guests tonight. Warm lighting, Scottish architecture background, clean modern typography."

# ── Task C ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Scenario 1: first choice unavailable
# Quote the specific message where the agent changed course. Min 20 words.
SCENARIO_1_PIVOT_MOMENT = """
The pivot happened after the Bow Bar check returned failure and the agent moved on to other venues.
The Bow Bar result showed capacity 80, status full, and meets_all_constraints false, so the agent had
to change course and evaluate other available pubs instead.
"""

SCENARIO_1_FALLBACK_VENUE = "The Albanach"

# Scenario 2: impossible constraint (300 guests)
# Did the agent recommend a pub name not in the known venues list?
SCENARIO_2_HALLUCINATED = False   # True or False

# Paste the final [AI] message.
SCENARIO_2_FINAL_ANSWER = """
None of the known venues meet the capacity and dietary requirements. The Albanach, The Haymarket Vaults, and The Guilford Arms have a capacity of 180, 160, and 200 respectively, which is less than the required capacity of 300. The Bow Bar has a capacity of 80, which is also less than the required capacity, and it is currently full. Therefore, none of the known venues can accommodate 300 people with vegan options.

# Scenario 3: out of scope (train times)
# Did the agent try to call a tool?
SCENARIO_3_TRIED_A_TOOL = False   # True or False

SCENARIO_3_RESPONSE = "Your input is lacking necessary details. Please provide more information or specify the task you need help with."

# Would this behaviour be acceptable in a real booking assistant? Min 30 words.
SCENARIO_3_ACCEPTABLE = """
Not really. It is better than hallucinating a train time, but it is still weak because the question is clear
and the assistant should recognise that train schedules are outside the available venue-booking tools. A better
response would clearly say that it cannot answer train-time questions with the current toolset.

# Compare the LangGraph graph to exercise3_rasa/data/rules.yml. Min 30 words.
TASK_D_COMPARISON = """

The LangGraph graph is very small and generic: one agent node can either end or call tools, then loop back.
That means the model decides the path at runtime. In Rasa, the behaviour is described explicitly in flows or
rules, so the assistant follows predefined business paths rather than freely choosing each next step.

"""

# ── Reflection ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# The most unexpected thing the agent did. Min 40 words.
# Must reference a specific behaviour from your run.

MOST_SURPRISING = """

The most unexpected behaviour was that in Task A the model appeared to produce tool-call JSON in its reply,
but the exercise still reported that no tool calls were actually made. Another surprising result was in
Scenario 1, where the agent checked multiple venues, found valid options, but still ended with a flyer
timeout and a messy final response instead of a clean booking recommendation.
